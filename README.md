# Awesome Seedance 2.0 Live-Action Workflows

A bilingual workflow library for AI filmmakers and short-form teams: cinematic shots, everyday life, performance, dialogue, and documentary/UGC.

> **Status:** Launch entries are reusable workflow templates, not claimed render tests. For real Seedance 2.0 outputs, use the [HiAPIAI prompt gallery](https://github.com/HiAPIAI/awesome-seedance-2-0-prompts). Previews are added only after permission and generation review.

This repository adapts the strongest navigation, asset-role, timeline, quality-gate, and contribution patterns from popular Seedance, AI short-film, and Awesome List projects while keeping every workflow original and live-action focused. See [reference repository research](docs/research-notes.md).

## Start In 60 Seconds

1. Pick a workflow from a category below.
2. Preview a text-to-video request without spending credits:

```bash
npm run generate -- night-corridor-suspense --dry-run
```

3. Set `HIAPI_API_KEY`, remove `--dry-run`, and the runner creates the task and waits for the result.
4. For image or reference workflows, repeat `--media key=url` to replace media placeholders.

For agent-run generation, install the [HiAPI Seedance 2.0 Video Skill](https://github.com/HiAPIAI/hiapi-seedance-2-0-video-skill).

## What Every Workflow Includes

- **Directorial intent:** what the scene must accomplish dramatically.
- **Reference roles:** which asset controls identity, location, motion, or sound.
- **Timed beats:** only the actions that can fit coherently in the clip.
- **Continuity locks:** identity, wardrobe, props, light direction, and geography.
- **Failure fixes:** change one variable per retake instead of rewriting everything.
- **HiAPI request:** the canonical `seedance-2.0` async `/v1/tasks` payload.
